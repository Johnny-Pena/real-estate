    review: 'having great coaches (trainers) to teaching you on how to learn in easy steps and making it fun at the same time, makes the biggest difference. Because I do think some do have a hard time learning and when they do they give up and quit. But when your trainer is showing you the tricks and talents that they posses, it makes it fun to learn. Thank you Jen (Trainer) and Trala.',
